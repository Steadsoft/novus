# novus
A new grammar for a .Net language.

This repo contains code that is in one way or another, related to the design of a grammar that is not based on C or it's derivatives. The grammar is intended to be able to create a language implementation that can do all that C# can do.

My blog contains articles related to this and this is where most of the in-depth analysis can be found.
