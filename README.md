A new grammar for a new .Net language.

This repo contains code that is in one way or another, related to the design of a grammar that is not based on C or it's derivatives. The grammar is intended to be able to create a language implementation that can do all that C# can do but offer improvements to how we extend the language over time.

My blog contains articles related to this and this is where most of the in-depth analysis can be found.

One of the main objectives is to simplify the process by which we can extend the language, make it easier to add new features and reduce the idiosyncracies that often arise in languages derived from C. The language can be extended by both adding new keywords or by adding new (what I term) "bultin" functions.

This is currently a research effort, so feedback is valued and encouraged.
